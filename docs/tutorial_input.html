<h1>Organize things for your book</h1>

<p>
  In this tutorial, you're going to learn how to organize things you want to have
  in your book and how to amplify them with Joytan's features such as
  automatic translation and automatic dictionary-lookup.
</p>

<h2>The structure of Entry</h2>

          alt="Structure of Entry" width=640 height=220>
    </a>

  </figure>
</center>

<p>
  Your book will consist of a number of "Entry", which is just like a dictionary
  entry.
  The structure of an Entry is a tree structure of depth 2, constructed with
  three sections; "atop", "def", and "ex".
</p>
<p>
  An Entry must have one and only one "atop" (<img src="./images/atop_label.png" />) section,
  which is placed on the top of its sections and represents the Entry
  like its title and heading.

<p>
  "def" (<img src="./images/def_label.png" />)
  will be used to overwrite and store the definitions of a word in
  the <img src="./images/atop_label.png" /> section if possible
  when you use automatic dictionary-lookup feature, but other than that
  you can use "def" section to store any Entry's item as it's like a
  bulleted list even if it's not a definition. The default number of
  definitions per an Entry is set to 1.
</p>

<p>
  Probably you may only use "ex" (<img src="./images/ex_label.png" />)
  section to store word examples when you use automatic dictionary-lookup.
  The default number of examples per a definition is set to 0 so you
  cannot see it unless you increment the number on the Preferences.
</p>

<p>
  The number of "def" and "ex" is shared over all of entries (EntryList).
  You can change the values from Preferences.
</p>

<h2>Using Spreadsheet</h2>

    </a>

</center>

<p>
  One of the facts that makes Joytan simple and  easy to use is
  it uses a comma-separated value (CSV) file as its core data file..
  For the reason, you can write and edit the entries of your book
  with common spreadsheet editor, such as Google Sheets and Excel,
  instead of launching Joytan. <b>Furthermore, with Google Sheets, you can
  collaborate with others to make a book anywhere, anytime.</b>
</p>

<h2>Load & Save</h2>
<p>
  You can open your CSV file in Joytan from File/Open (shortcut: Ctrl+O).
  After editing the content of the file, don't forget to save the content
  on Joytan. You can save it from File/Save (shortcut: Ctrl+S).
</p>

<h2>Automatic dictionary-lookup</h2>
This is the feature where the statement: "Joytan is made for
 language-learners" comes from and the reason why Joytan uses a depth-2 tree
 structure. You can activate the feature by clicking the
 <img src="./images/download_button.png" /> button
 at the bottom of the Welcome Page.
  Currently, Joytan is able to automatically download dictionary entries from
 <a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> and
 <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/">Dictionary.com</a>.

<h2>Automatic translation</h2>
Joytan is able to translate the text in Entry's sections using Google Translation.
You can activate the feature by clicking the
   <img src="./images/translate_button.png" /> button
   at the bottom of the Welcome Page.

<h2>Next</h2>
<p>
  Alright, now you've passed everything you want in your book to Joytan and
  completed the most laborious part of Joytan.
</p>

<p>
  You are ready to create both of your original audiobook and textbook.
  If you want both of them, I suggest you make an audiobook first because
  the process of making textbooks is extremely fast (although downloading
  online images for a textbook may take considerable time) but
  you will have to wait for a few minutes until Joytan finishes making
  your audiobook.
